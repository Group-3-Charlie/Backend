# Backend

Aictron is a web app that allows its users to get predictive data analysis by inserting any csv dataset. The app will
use artificial intelligence, and more precisely machine learning with SKlearn Python library. The main advantage is a
lightweight application, as machine-learning algorithms are resource-efficient, making it particularly useful for anyone
needing to make predictions based on specific data. The app is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive
interface. The user will be able to upload a dataset, select the target column and then get the prediction.
